His truth is marching on. 

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! 
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!

He has sounded forth the trumpet 
    that shall never sound retreat; 
He is sifting out the hearts

Oh, be swift, my soul,

Our God is marching on.

From His sacred veins.

In that blood I find; 
Blessed be His compassion, 
Infinitely kind. 

Abel’s blood for vengeance 
Pleaded to the skies; 
But the blood of Jesus 
For our pardon cries. 
Oft as it is sprinkled 
On our guilty hearts, 
Satan, in confusion, 
Terror-struck, departs.

Swell the mighty flood; 
Louder still and louder 
Praise the precious blood!

When we walk with the Lord 
in the light of His word, 
What a glory He sheds on our way! 
While we do His good will, 
He abides with us still, 
And with all who will trust and obey. 

Trust and obey, 
for there’s no other way 
To be happy in Jesus, 
but to trust and obey. 

Not a burden we bear, 
not a sorrow we share, 
But our toil He doth richly repay; 
Not a grief nor a loss, 
not a frown nor a cross, 
But is blessed if we trust and obey. 

Trust and obey, 
for there’s no other way 
To be happy in Jesus, 
but to trust and obey. 

But we never can prove 
the delights  of His love 
Until all on the altar we lay; 
For the favor He shows 
and the joy He bestows, 
Are for those who will trust and obey. 

Trust and obey, 
for there’s no other way 
To be happy in Jesus, 
but to trust and obey. 

Then in fellowship sweet 
we will sit at His feet. 
Or we’ll walk by His side in the way. 
What He says we will do, 
where He sends we will go; 
Never fear, only trust and obey. 

Trust and obey,

Ruined sinners to reclaim. 
Hallelujah! What a Savior! 

Bearing shame and scoffing rude, 
In my place condemned He stood; 
Sealed my pardon with His blood. 
Hallelujah! What a Saviour! 

Guilty, vile, and helpless we; 
Spotless Lamb of God was He; 
“Full atonement!” can it be? 
Hallelujah! What a Saviour! 

Lifted up was He to die;

an old rugged cross, 
The emblem of suffering and shame;

the dearest and best 
For a world of lost sinners was slain. 
So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross, 
Till my trophies at last I lay down; 
I will cling to the old rugged cross, 
And exchange it some day for a crown. 

O that old rugged cross, 
so despised by the world, 
Has a wondrous attraction for me; 
For the dear Lamb of God left  
His glory above 
To bear it to dark Calvary. 
So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross, 
Till my trophies at last I lay down; 
I will cling to the old rugged cross, 
And exchange it some day for a crown. 

In that old rugged cross, 
stained with blood so divine, 
A wondrous beauty I see, 
For ’twas on that old cross 
Jesus suffered and died, 
To pardon and sanctify me. 
So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross, 
Till my trophies at last I lay down; 
I will cling to the old rugged cross, 
And exchange it some day for a crown. 

To the old rugged cross 
I will ever be true; 
Its shame and reproach gladly bear; 
Then He’ll call me some day  
to my home far away, 
Where His glory forever I’ll share.

Where would I be 
If you had not been by my side 
How could I rise to meet 
The morning of the day 
Your tender mercy 
Always calling from behind 
At times I could not see You 
Even though You were close by

Lord You are good 
You are good 
And your mercy forever endures

Help me to see Your loving kindness 
Help me to see You as You are 
Help me to see Your loving kindness 
Help me to see You as You are

Through the judgment You received
And You’ve won my heart

Trade these ashes in for beauty
And wear forgiveness like a crown 
Coming to kiss the feet of mercy  v
I lay every burden down 
At the foot of the cross

At the foot of the cross 
Where I am made complete 
You have given me life 
Through the death you bore for me 
And You’ve won my heart 
And You’ve won my heart 
Now I can

I lay every burden down     
I lay every burden down 
At the foot of the cross
At the foot of the cross
At the foot of the cross

That His love is everlasting 
And His mercies they will never end

My life is in your hands

Only what I have done

Will stand the test of time 

Lord, your mercy is so great 
That you look beyond our weakness 
That you found purest gold in miry clay 
Turning sinners into saints 

I will always

Here on earth and in heaven after 
For you’ve joined me at my true home
